preparation de la (les) response(s) en fonction de la requete


Cas d'exemple simple et simplifié:
	Suppose, you have entered localhost:8080/info.html in the address bar.
	In the server Terminal we get the following Request Headers:
	GET /info.html HTTP/1.1

	So, we just have to search for the info.html file in current directory
	(as / specifies that it is looking in the root directory of the server. 
	If it is like /messages/info.html then we have to look inside messages folder for info.html file).

	There are many cases here to consider. Some of them are:
		The file(web page) is present
		The file(web page) is absent
		The client doesn’t have permissions to access the file (web page).
	And many more…..

	1.	select appropriate status code from here
	2.	if the file is present and the client has permissions to access it, then select appropriate Content-Type from here
	3. 	open the file
		read the data into a variable
		Count the number of bytes read from the file (when you read a simple text file, use return value of the read function)
		Set the Content-Length.
	4.	then construct the Response Header
	5.	add a newline at the end of Response Header
		append the data to it which we have read from the file (if and only if the file is present and the client has permissions to access it)
	6.	send the response header to the client
